  Brief summary of the basic ideas developed for how the game would function

  For starters: the board will be stored in a 2d array of definite size as such:
            (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4)
         (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
      (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)
   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)
(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (4,8)
   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)
      (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)
         (7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5)
            (8,0) (8,1) (8,2) (8,3) (8,4)

 Each outside face of the hexagons will be labeled with a number as well
